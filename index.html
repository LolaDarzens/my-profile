  			<header><H2> <p> Being an only child, I have developped quite early an important creativity and imagination. Channeled through entertainment, writing and music, my little world of Narnia increases a hundredfold what happens to me. </H2></header></p></H2>

			<H3>🎥 Entertainment 🎥</H3>
 			<p><strong>Whether it'd be series, movies or drama, I'm here for it. I am always curious to see what happens in everyone's mind. What did you think to write that ? Who did it come from ? Favourite serie : Twin Peaks. Favourite movies : The Neverending Story / Captain Fantastic. Favourite play : Le Porteur d'Histoire</strong></p>

  			<H3>✍🏻 Writing ✍🏻</H3>
  			<p><strong>My mind gets crazy at night. Dreams and nightmares have shaped me into happiness and horror : welcome to my book. I could not have lived without my book. And it's bad, really bad, but my kind of bad. It's called <em>For the love of blood</em>.</strong></p>

  			<H3>🎶 Music 🎶</H3>
  			<p><strong>My taste in music is quite ecclectic. I love heavy metal as much as the 70s disco songs. The music I like, is music I've heard when I was a child or music that my mind has associated with memories or music with powerful lyrics. Because I need a connexion with music, if a music does not open Narnia, I won't like it.</strong></p>
